# jerwng.com

This repo contains the source files for my personal site at: http://jerwng.com

The site is run on a simple Node.js server (server.js) where source files are served from /public.

To run the site on localhost:8080/:
* simply have npm and nodejs installed using your favorite package manager (ie. apt-get) 
* run "npm install in the root directory to install all necessary node modules"
* node server.js to start the server and open a browser to localhost:8080 to view the webpage
