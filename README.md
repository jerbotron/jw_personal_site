# jw_personal_site

This repo contains the source files for my personal site at: http://jerwng.com

The site is run on a simple Python Flask server (server.py) where static files are served from locally directories. 

To run the site on localhost:5000/, simply have Python2.7+ and python-flask installed and run command "python server.py" from the top directory.
